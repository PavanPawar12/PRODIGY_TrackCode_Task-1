# 📊 Task 01 - Population Data Visualization | Prodigy InfoTech Internship

This project is part of the **Data Science Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 📝 Task Objective
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a **categorical** or **continuous** variable.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [World Bank - Total Population](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
- Contains population data for all countries and regions from 1960 to 2022.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- ✅ Filtered data to include only **actual countries** (excluding regions like "World", "High income", etc.)
- ✅ Extracted population values for the year **2022**
- ✅ Created visualizations using Python libraries

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Bar Chart** showing the **Top 10 Most Populated Countries in 2022**
- **Histogram** representing the **distribution of population** across all countries

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Python**
- Libraries: **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- Tools: **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

## 📌 Key Insights
- India and China are leading in population count globally.
- Most countries have a significantly lower population than the top 5.
- The population distribution is right-skewed (few very large countries, many small).

## 🏁 Outcome
A clear and insightful representation of population data using real-world statistics — fulfilling Task 01 of the internship.
